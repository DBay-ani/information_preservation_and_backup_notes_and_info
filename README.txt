Overview
===============================================================================

This repository houses material that I have used, found useful, or considered
insightful when I have gone about trying to preserve, document, or backup my 
digital materials. I have had written notes on the subject for quite awhile, 
which I used both to remind myself of the processes/details and to share 
suggestions with peers. Ultimately, I would like to get most of my non-sensitive 
notes and scripts into this repo. In the short-term, however, most likely 
the content will trickle in, pieces at a time.

If you have any feedback or suggestions, I would be happy to hear them. The best
ways to go about this are to start a discussion in the discussion-tab, submit
an issue in the issue-tab, or submit a pull-request for adding your own changes.
Details about which option to choose can be found at:
    https://github.com/DBay-ani/information_preservation_and_backup_notes_and_info/discussions
Feel no hesitation to use any of these options.

About Licenses on Material in this Repository
===============================================================================

For text geared exclusively toward human consumption as opposed to machine
reading (such as this README.txt file), I intend to use the 
CC BY-ND 4.0 License (the
Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License). See, for
instance, the end of this file. 

For code and related machine-read/machine-instructional material, I intend
to provide an MIT license. A copy of the MIT license will occur in each 
subdirectory it applies, along with a clear indication of its application to the
relevant files. For an example of this, see the subdirectory 
"scriptsForCollectingFileMetadata" .

If someone has a compelling use-case or general reason for me to license
differently - either in general or for them specifically - please feel 
free to reach out. ...Realistically speaking, it seems doubtful that anyone
other than me would find enough utility in this material to proceed with 
a use-case requiring these licenses, but the gate is open in the off-chance
that occurs.
